# mlh-YAML
Header only library for serializing and deserializing YAML files.

# Sources
Heavily inspired by: https://github.com/nlohmann/json

# Plan
The plan is to have a library that can parse any YAML files with all of the newest YAML features. To get to that point, I want to implement the features step by step as described here: https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#chapter-2-language-overview

# Status
The project is still in it's earliest of stages and completely non-functional.
